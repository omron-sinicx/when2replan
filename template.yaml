overview: |
  The hierarchy of global and local planners is one of the most commonly utilized system designs in autonomous robot navigation. While the global planner generates a reference path from the current to goal locations based on the pre-built map, the local planner produces a kinodynamic trajectory to follow the reference path while avoiding perceived obstacles. To account for unforeseen or dynamic obstacles not present on the pre-built map, **``when to replan''** the reference path is critical for the success of safe and efficient navigation. However, determining the ideal timing to execute replanning in such partially unknown environments still remains an open question. In this work, we first conduct an extensive simulation experiment to compare several common replanning strategies and confirm that effective strategies are highly dependent on the environment as well as the global and local planners. Based on this insight, we then derive a new adaptive replanning strategy based on deep reinforcement learning, which can learn from experience to decide appropriate replanning timings in the given environment and planning setups. Our experimental results show that the proposed replanner can perform on par or even better than the current best-performing strategies in multiple situations regarding navigation robustness and efficiency.

      We derive a replanning controller that can learn from its previous navigation experiences to create a better replanning
      timing for navigation efficiency and robustness. As illustrated in the following figure,
      the replanner’s action is essentially the same as that of existing replanning strategies, i.e., binary actions indicating whether or not to execute replanning to produce
      a new reference path for the local planner after the current
      time step $k$. In other words, the replanner can potentially be
      utilized as a replacement module for the replanning strategy
      in existing planning frameworks, thus making it compatible
      with various combinations of planners and other modules.
