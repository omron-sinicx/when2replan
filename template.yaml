overview: |
  Transfer reinforcement learning (RL) aims at improving learning efficiency of an agent by exploiting knowledge from other source agents trained on relevant tasks.
  However, it remains challenging to transfer knowledge between different environmental dynamics without having access to the source environments.
  In this work, we explore a new challenge in transfer RL, where only a set of source policies collected under unknown diverse dynamics is available for learning a target task efficiently.
  To address this problem, the proposed approach, **MULTI-source POLicy AggRegation (MULTIPOLAR)**, comprises two key techniques.
  We learn to aggregate the actions provided by the source policies adaptively to maximize the target task performance.
  Meanwhile, we learn an auxiliary network that predicts residuals around the aggregated actions, which ensures the target policy”s expressiveness even when some of the source policies perform poorly.
  We demonstrated the effectiveness of MULTIPOLAR through an extensive experimental evaluation across six simulated environments ranging from classic control problems to challenging robotics simulations, under both continuous and discrete action spaces.

      This is a multi-line text example.
      "> - Flow Style" converts newlines to spaces.
      Using >, newline characters are converted to spaces.
      Newline characters and indentation are handled appropriately, and the text is represented as a single line.
      It's suitable when you want to collapse multi-line text into a single line, such as in configurations or descriptions where readability is key.

      text example.
      "| - Block Style" preserves newlines and indentation.
      Using |, you can represent multi-line text that includes newline characters.
      Newline characters are preserved exactly as they are, along with the block's indentation.
      It's suitable when maintaining newlines and indentation is important, such as preserving the structure of code or prose.
